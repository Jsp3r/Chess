What Is the French Defense?

To start: White moves this pawn forward

Black responds by moving this pawn forward

White then moves d2 pawn to d4

And Black replies by moving d7 pawn to d5

and that is the french defense

The idea behind the French Defense is that Black plays e6 to prepare to advance d7-d5, in order to immediately challenge Whiteâ€™s pawn on e4.
