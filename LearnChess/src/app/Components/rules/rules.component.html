    <h3>Chess Game Rules</h3>

    <h4>Nature of the Game of Chess</h4>
        <p>The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately
        on a square board called a ‘chessboard’. The player with the white pieces commences the
        game. A player is said to ‘have the move’, when his opponent’s move has been ‘made’.
        The objective of each player is to place the opponent’s king ‘under attack’ in such a way
        that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have
        ‘checkmated’ the opponent’s king and to have won the game. Leaving one’s own king
        under attack, exposing one’s own king to attack and also ’capturing’ the opponent’s king
        are not allowed. The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.
        If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.

        <p>The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the
            ‘white’ squares) and dark (the ‘black’ squares). The chessboard is placed between the players 
            in such a way that the near corner square to the right of the player is white.      
            The eight vertical columns of squares are called ‘files’. The eight horizontal rows of squares are 
            called ‘ranks’. A straight line of squares of the same colour, running from one
            edge of the board to an adjacent edge, is called a ‘diagonal’. At the beginning 
            of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces (the ‘white’ pieces); 
            the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the ‘black’ pieces).

    <h4>The Moves of the Pieces</h4>
    <p>It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. If
        a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece the latter is captured and
        removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an
        opponent’s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square.
        <br>A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving
        to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under
        attack.

                <p>The King is the most important piece in chess. If the king is trapped so that its capture is unavoidable, the game is over and that player loses. The king has little mobility, so it is also considered one of the weakest pieces in the game. The king can move to any adjacent square. That is, it can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It cannot move onto a square occupied by a piece of the same color. The king captures another piece in the same way it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece. There is an additional limit on the movement of the king. The king may not move to a square which would put the king under attack by an opposing piece (called in “check”). As a result of this limit, two kings may never stand next to each other - since moving next to the opposing king would put the moving king into check. The king can also be forced to move or capture if the king is under attack (“check”) and the only way to stop the attack is to move the king</p>
                <p>The King may not move to a square:</p>

                <p>The Bishop moves in a straight line diagonally on the board. It can move as many squares as wanted, until it meets the end of the board or another piece. The bishop cannot jump over other pieces. The bishop captures on the same path it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece. Because of the way the bishop moves, the piece always remains on the same color squares it started on. Each player begins with two bishops, one on the black-colored and one on the white-colored squares. They are frequently referred to as the “dark-squared” bishop and “light-squared” bishop. The bishops can also be named according to the side they begin on - king's bishop and queen's bishop.</p>

                <p>The Knight is the most special piece in chess, having a flexibility that makes it a powerful piece. The knight is the only piece on the board that may jump over other pieces. The knight moves two squares horizontally or vertically and then one more square at a right-angle. The knight’s move is shaped as an “L”. The knight always lands on a square opposite in color from its initial square. The knight can jump over pieces of either color while going to its destination square, but it does not capture any pieces it jumps over. The knight captures by landing on the square of the opposing piece. The knight cannot land on a square occupied by a piece of the same color. Since the knight's movement is not in a straight line, it can attack a queen, bishop, or rook without being reciprocally attacked by that piece.</p>

                <p>The pawn is the most numerous and the least powerful piece on the chessboard. Pawns are unusual in their movement. Generally the pawn moves forward only, one square at a time. An exception is the first time a pawn is moved, it may move forward two squares. The pawn cannot jump over other pieces; any piece directly in front of a pawn blocks its advance to that square. The pawn is the only piece that cannot move backward. The pawn is also the only piece that does not capture in the same way that it moves. The pawn captures an opposing piece by moving diagonally one square - it cannot capture by moving straight ahead.
                <br>The pawn also is involved in two special moves. The first is the en passant capture where a pawn is captured on its initial two square move. When the rule to allow a pawn to move two squares on its first move was added, a pawn could potentially evade capture by an opponent's pawn by going past a square under attack. The en passant capture (from the French for “in passing”) was added to prevent this. The capture is made exactly as if the pawn had moved only one square forward. 
                <br>
                </p>
                <img src="https://sakkpalota.hu/images/sakk/rulesimg/gyalog5.jpg" alt="En Passant" width="200">
                There are special conditions for the en passant capture:
                <!-- unordered list -->
                <ul>
                    <li>A pawn must move two squares from its initial position in a single move.</li>
                    <li>An opposing pawn must be attacking the square the first pawn moved over.</li>
                    <li>The first pawn can be captured as if it moved only one square.</li>
                    <li>The capture can only be made at the opponent's next move. If the capture is not made, the first pawn is safe from en passant capture for the remainder of the game.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="https://sakkpalota.hu/images/sakk/rulesimg/gyalog3.jpg" alt="Promotion" width="200">
                <p>
                The second is the pawn promotion where a pawn is promoted to another piece when the pawn reaches the other end of the board. When a pawn has reached the other end of the board it cannot move further, since it always must move forward and not backwards. The pawn is then turned (“promoted”) into a queen, rook, bishop or knight. This promotion occurs as part of the move. Usually the piece chosen is the queen, often called “queening”. The other pieces are sometimes chosen when their movements will aid in checkmate, often called “under promoting”. The pawn can be turned into a piece even if that type of piece is still on the board. Thus you can have two queens or three rooks, bishops or knights in play at once.

                    <p>Castling uses the king and one rook, and is the only time in a game when more than one piece may be moved during a single turn. In castling a king is moved two squares towards the rook and the rook is then moved to the square on the other side of the king.
                    </p>
                    Castling has some rigid requirements:

                            <li>The king is not in check.</li>
                            <li>The king does not cross over a square that is attacked by the opponent's pieces.</li>
                            <li>The king does not end the move on a square that is attacked by the opponent's pieces. (The castling move cannot end with the king in check.)</li>

                    <p>There are two forms of castling. One is called “kingside castling”. It is also known as “short castling”, since it is performed to the short side of the board and the rook only has to move two squares to the opposite side of the king.</p>

    <h4>The Completion of the Game</h4>
    <p>The game is won by the player who has checkmated his opponent’s king. This
        immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate
        position was a legal move and whose opponent declares he resigns. This
        immediately ends the game.
